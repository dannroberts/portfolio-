## Short Answer Q&A

```
Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today.
```
the 1980s,the internet was mainly used by the military. The first network intended for non-government use was called CSNET and by 1982. it connected 24 global sites (universities and other research centres). It was then that the Domain Name System was introduced, shortly followed by suffixes such as .com and .gov. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee proposed and created a network standardization that allowed different computers on the network to access the same "websites". This was called the hypertext transfer protocol and was the beginning of the word wide web (www). In 1990, the first search engine was created and in 1993, the first web browser was released. In 1996, the first mobile phone with internet access was released by Nokia.

Define and describe the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers.
```
- Domains are a group of computers that can be , accessed and administered with a common set of rules.
- A web server is a system that delivers content or services to end users over the internet. A web server consists of a physical server, server operating system (OS) and software used to facilitate HTTP communication. A web server is just a internet server
- Domain Name Servers (DNS) are like phonebooks for the internet. They maintain a directory of domain names and translate them to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
- Web browsers are applictaions used to access websites

Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today.
```
The develpoment of social media has changed the way we use the internet and commmunicate with eachother, its now instantaneous. the world modern world wont function with out it.
